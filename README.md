## Setup

### Environment Files

This project uses environment variables defined in `.env` files to manage different configurations for different flavors (e.g., `prod`, `staging`). 

1. **Create `.env` files for each flavor:**

   - **For Staging**: Create `.env.staging` file
   - **For Production**: Create `.env.prod` file

   Example of variables in `.env` files:
   ```env
   API_URL=https://staging.api.example.com  # For staging
   API_URL=https://api.example.com          # For production
   ```

2. **Add the `.env` files to your project:**
   - Place `.env.staging` and `.env.prod` in the root of your project.

3. **Load environment variables based on the active flavor.** 
   The `.env` file will be automatically loaded depending on the selected flavor.

### How to Use Flavors

To use different environment configurations for different flavors (`staging`, `prod`), follow the steps below:

1. **Define the flavors in `flutter` configuration:**
   - Open your `ios/Runner.xcodeproj` or `android/app/build.gradle` and ensure the flavors (`prod`, `staging`) are defined.

2. **Use the flavor when building the app**:

   - You can run the app with a specific flavor by passing it in the terminal using the `--flavor` flag:
   
     ```bash
     flutter run --flavor prod
     flutter run --flavor staging
     ```

### Custom Script to Run with Flavors

You can use a custom script (`flutter.sh`) to simplify running the app with flavors.

1. **Create `flutter.sh` script**: (Make sure the script is executable)
   
   Create a `flutter.sh` file in the root of your project:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   if [ "$1" == "--flavor" ]; then
     if [ "$2" == "prod" ]; then
       flutter run --flavor prod
     elif [ "$2" == "staging" ]; then
       flutter run --flavor staging
     else
       echo "Invalid flavor. Use 'prod' or 'staging'."
     fi
   else
     echo "Usage: flutter.sh --flavor <flavor_name>"
   fi
   ```

2. **Make the script executable**:

   ```bash
   chmod +x flutter.sh
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   
   To run the app with the desired flavor, use the following command:

   ```bash
   ./flutter.sh --flavor prod
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   ./flutter.sh --flavor staging
   ```

This custom script will handle the correct flavor setup based on the arguments passed.

## Running the App

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter-gym-scan.git
   cd flutter-gym-scan
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the app with the desired flavor (either `prod` or `staging`):

   ```bash
   ./flutter.sh --flavor prod
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   ./flutter.sh --flavor staging
   ```

## Assets

- Images and icons are stored in the `assets/` directory.
- Lottie animations are stored in `assets/lotties/`.
